# Movie-Review-Sentiment-Analysis

**Project Summary:**

- **Project Name:** Movie Review Sentiment Analysis
- **Objective:** Develop a text classification model to determine sentiment (positive/negative) in IMDb movie reviews.

**Tech Stack:**

- **Programming Languages:** Python
- **Deep Learning Framework:** PyTorch
- **NLP Library:** torchtext
- **Data Preprocessing:** Tokenization, GloVe word embeddings
- **Model Architecture:** Bidirectional GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)
- **Optimization:** AdamW optimizer
- **Loss Function:** Binary Cross-Entropy with Logits
- **Device:** CPU/GPU (based on availability)

**Key Achievements:**

- Preprocessed IMDb movie review dataset, tokenized text, and used pre-trained word embeddings for feature representation.
- Developed a deep learning model based on a bidirectional GRU for text sentiment classification.
- Implemented training and evaluation pipelines, including functions for calculating accuracy and tracking training progress.
- Achieved a test accuracy of 86.66% in sentiment classification.
- Ensured code reproducibility by setting a random seed and effectively used PyTorch's GPU support for faster training.

This project showcases proficiency in natural language processing (NLP), deep learning, and the PyTorch framework, as well as strong data preprocessing skills for text data.
